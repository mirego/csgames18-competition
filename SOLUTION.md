## Solution

**Platform:** {iOS}

**Features:**
1. {A really good part list is up and ready for action! Displays the name, description, and location, like the example provided}
2. {Changed the views to be UITableView/UITableViewCell as it felt more appropriate for the task.}
3. {Ability to access the mapping from AWS, and parse the JSON directly into a list of NSDictionary, which is nice to quickly get information from.}

**Build Steps:**
- {We did not touch anything with the pod file, etc. So just run and go to see the part list!}

**What went well or wrong:**
- {The base project was helpful to get our feet off the ground and get a handle of what was going on.}
- {The rubric and outline were great, you knew exactly what you had to do. }
- {Some minor problems in trying to get the data to populate our table set us back a little}
- {Using iOS simulator made getting the current location difficult}

**What you are proud or disappointed of:**
- {We really liked the fact that we could implement the part list dynamically }
- {We were really disappointed we could not make it to the AR, that looked really cool.}
- {Implementing table views, since we think that is how it should be done on iOS}

- {The map got away from us unfortunately }
- {We could not get the location simulator to work so we could test our solution. Theoretically it should though}
